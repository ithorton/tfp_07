# Forensic Accounting Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains code, Jupyter notebooks, and visualizations for a team project focused on forensic accounting. The project explores techniques for detecting financial anomalies, fraud patterns, and irregularities in accounting data using data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools.

Key components:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analyses for data exploration, anomaly detection models, and case studies.
- **Graphs and Visualizations**: Charts and plots (e.g., generated with Matplotlib or Seaborn) illustrating financial trends, outliers, and forensic insights.
- **Other Code**: Python scripts for data processing, automation, and utility functions.

# Other notes:
I used an Anaconda virtual environment to load a space to run the Jupyter notebooks
